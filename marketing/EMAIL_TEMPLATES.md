## Email 2: Tips & Tricks (Send 3 days after welcome)

**Subject**: 5 VibeKanban tips you probably didn't know

**Preview Text**: Get more done with these productivity hacks

**Body**:

```
Hey!

You've been using VibeKanban for a few days now. Nice!

Here are 5 tips to level up your productivity game:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ LIMIT YOUR "IN PROGRESS" COLUMN

The secret to productivity isn't doing more things at once.
It's finishing what you start.

Try limiting your "In Progress" column to 2-3 tasks max.

Focus. Finish. Feel the dopamine hit of dragging to "Done."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2️⃣ CREATE COLUMNS FOR YOUR WORKFLOW

Default columns (TODO, In Progress, Done) are great.
But custom columns are POWERFUL.

Ideas for custom workflows:

For Developers:
Backlog → Dev → Code Review → Testing → Deployed

For Designers:
Inspiration → Sketches → Design → Feedback → Final

For Writers:
Ideas → Outline → Draft → Edit → Published

For Students:
Assigned → Research → Writing → Submitted

Make VibeKanban work for YOU.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3️⃣ USE TASK NOTES FOR DETAILS

Keep task titles short (under 50 chars).
Put details, links, and context in the notes section.

Click any task → Add notes with full details.

Your board stays clean, but information is there when you need it.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4️⃣ FRIDAY RESET RITUAL

End every Friday by:
1. Dragging completed tasks to "Done" (so satisfying)
2. Moving unfinished tasks back to "TODO"
3. Adding next week's priorities

Start Monday with a clean slate and clear priorities.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5️⃣ IT WORKS OFFLINE

Airport WiFi terrible? Coffee shop internet down?

VibeKanban works 100% offline.

Your data is stored locally on YOUR device.
No internet required. No loading spinners. Just productivity.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💬 YOUR TURN

## Email 10: Behind-the-Scenes

**Subject**: The story behind VibeKanban's design

**Preview Text**: Why every pixel matters

**Body**:

```
Hey!

Ever wonder why VibeKanban looks the way it does?

Let me pull back the curtain. 🎭

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎨 THE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

When I started designing VibeKanban, I had one rule:

"Every pixel should spark joy."

Not in a cheesy way. In a "this tool makes me smile" way.

Because here's the truth:
If your productivity tool doesn't make you happy, you won't use it.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🌈 THE COLOR PALETTE

The pastel colors took 2 weeks to perfect.

I tested 47 different combinations.

Why pastels?
• Easy on the eyes (no harsh contrast)
• Professional but friendly
• Accessible (WCAG AA compliant)
• Different enough to distinguish columns
• Similar enough to feel cohesive

[Image of color palette]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✨ THE ANIMATIONS

Every animation in VibeKanban is intentional:

Drag scale: 1.02x
→ Feels like you're picking up a physical card

Shadow increase on drag
→ Creates depth and confirms interaction

200ms spring animation on drop
→ Smooth enough to feel premium, fast enough to not slow you down

Why animations matter:
They provide visual feedback that makes your brain happy.

[GIF of smooth drag-and-drop]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔤 THE TYPOGRAPHY

System fonts (-apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto)

Why not a fancy custom font?
• Loads instantly (no font files to download)
• Familiar to users (their OS font)
• Optimized for readability
• Respectful of user preferences
• Lightweight (better performance)

Form follows function.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚡ THE PERFORMANCE

Every design decision considered performance:

• Soft shadows instead of heavy gradients
• CSS transforms instead of position changes
• Lazy loading for modals
• Debounced saves to localStorage

Beautiful AND fast.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💭 THE PHILOSOPHY

Great design isn't about making things pretty.

It's about making things FEEL RIGHT.

VibeKanban should feel like:
• A premium product (but free)
• A trusted tool (private and safe)
• A joy to use (smooth and beautiful)

That's what we optimize for.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

1. Details matter more than you think
2. Performance IS user experience
3. Accessibility and beauty aren't opposites
4. Simplicity takes more work than complexity
5. Users notice when you care

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💬 YOUR TURN

What design element do you love most about VibeKanban?
What would you change?

Reply and let me know. I read every email.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Keep creating beautiful things,

**Unsubscribe:** One-click, no questions asked

**Privacy Note:** Add this to footer:
"We respect your privacy. We'll never sell your email. Unsubscribe anytime."

### Email Design Guidelines

**Keep it simple:**
- Plain text is fine (actually preferred by many)
- Minimal HTML if you must
- No heavy images (fast loading)
- Mobile-responsive

**Structure:**
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Use separators (━━━) for visual breaks
- Emoji sparingly (adds personality without overdoing it)
- Clear CTAs (one primary action per email)

**Tone:**
- Friendly, not corporate
- Honest, not salesy
- Helpful, not pushy
- Human, not robotic

### A/B Testing Ideas

Test these elements:
- Subject line length (short vs detailed)
- Emoji in subject line (yes vs no)
- Send time (morning vs afternoon)
- CTA wording ("Try it now" vs "Get started" vs "Check it out")
- Email length (short vs detailed)
- Personal vs company voice

### Privacy-First Email Marketing

**Respect users:**
- Explicit opt-in only (no pre-checked boxes)
- Easy unsubscribe (one click, no login required)
- No tracking pixels (or disclose them)
- No third-party data sharing
- Frequency control (let users choose)

**Be transparent:**
- Explain why you're emailing
- Show what data you have
- Allow data export/deletion
- No dark patterns

This aligns with VibeKanban's privacy-first philosophy.
