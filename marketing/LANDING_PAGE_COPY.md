## Problem Section

### Headline
**Tired of Ugly, Bloated Project Management Tools?**

### Body Copy
You've tried them all. Trello feels corporate. Notion is overwhelming. Jira makes you want to quit your job.

Most Kanban boards look like they were designed in 2008 by someone who hates color, smooth animations, and human happiness.

**You deserve better.**

### Pain Points (Icon + Text Grid)

**🔐 Privacy Concerns**
Your tasks are your business. Why should they live on someone else's server?

**⏱️ Signup Fatigue**
Another account? Another password? Another "verify your email" flow? No thanks.

**💰 Pricing Tiers**
"Basic," "Pro," "Enterprise"—just to organize your to-dos? Pass.

**🐌 Slow & Laggy**
Loading spinners, API calls, cloud sync delays. Productivity shouldn't wait for the internet.

**😵 Feature Bloat**
Integrations, power-ups, dashboards, reports—sometimes you just need a simple Kanban board.

**😴 Boring Design**
If your todo board doesn't make you smile, you won't use it. Design matters.

## FAQ Section

### Headline
**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Do I really not need to create an account?**
A: Really! No account, no email, no password. Just open and use. Your data stays in your browser's local storage.

**Q: Is my data really private?**
A: Yes. Everything is stored locally on YOUR device. We literally can't access it—it never leaves your browser. No cloud sync, no data collection, no tracking.

**Q: What if I clear my browser data?**
A: Your tasks will be deleted (they're stored in localStorage). We're working on an export feature so you can back up your data.

**Q: Can I use it on multiple devices?**
A: Currently, VibeKanban is local-only, so each device has its own board. We're considering an optional (opt-in, privacy-conscious) cloud sync feature.

**Q: Is it really free forever?**
A: Yes. No trials, no "freemium" bait-and-switch. Core features are free forever. If we add premium features later, they'll be clearly optional.

**Q: Can I self-host it?**
A: Absolutely! VibeKanban is open source. Clone the repo, deploy to Vercel/Netlify/anywhere, and you're good to go.

**Q: Does it work on mobile?**
A: Yes! The responsive design works on phones and tablets. We're also planning native mobile apps.

**Q: Can I collaborate with my team?**
A: Not yet. VibeKanban is currently designed for individual use. Team features may come in the future based on user demand.

**Q: How do I contribute to the project?**
A: We'd love your help! Check out the GitHub repo for "good first issues" and contributing guidelines.

**Q: What happens if you shut down?**
A: Because it's local-first and open source, VibeKanban works independently of us. Clone the repo, self-host it, and it's yours forever.

## Conversion Optimization Notes

### Above the Fold Must-Haves
1. Clear value proposition
2. Visual of the product
3. Obvious CTA button
4. Trust indicators

### Psychological Triggers
- **Instant gratification:** "3 seconds to start"
- **Loss aversion:** "No signup = no wasted time"
- **Social proof:** "10,000+ GitHub stars"
- **Scarcity (sort of):** "Free forever (not a trial)"
- **Authority:** "Featured on Product Hunt, Hacker News"

### A/B Testing Ideas
- Hero headline variations
- CTA button color (purple gradient vs. teal)
- CTA text ("Try Now" vs. "Get Started" vs. "Open VibeKanban")
- Above-the-fold layout (product left vs. right)
- Testimonial placement
- Video demo vs. GIF vs. static screenshots

### Heatmap Predictions
- Users will focus on: Hero product image, CTA button, "No signup" badge
- Users will scroll to: Feature grid, comparison table, testimonials
- Users might miss: Footer links, technical details (unless developer)

### Mobile Optimization
- Stack sections vertically
- Larger tap targets (min 44px)
- Simplified navigation
- Faster loading (optimize images)
- Sticky CTA button at bottom

## Brand Voice Guidelines

### Personality
- **Friendly** but not overly casual
- **Confident** but not arrogant
- **Honest** but not boring
- **Playful** but not unprofessional

### Do's
✓ Use "you" and "your" (conversational)
✓ Be specific ("3 seconds" not "fast")
✓ Acknowledge pain points honestly
✓ Show, don't just tell (screenshots, GIFs)
✓ Explain the "why" behind features

### Don'ts
✗ Corporate jargon ("synergy", "leverage", "empower")
✗ Over-the-top claims ("revolutionary", "groundbreaking")
✗ Vague benefits ("increase productivity by 10x")
✗ Passive voice ("Your tasks can be organized")
✗ Buzzwords without substance ("AI-powered", "blockchain-based")

### Example Rewrites

**Bad:** "Leverage our innovative platform to synergize your workflow"
**Good:** "Open and start organizing in 3 seconds"

**Bad:** "Revolutionary task management solution"
**Good:** "A Kanban board that doesn't look like it's from 2008"

**Bad:** "Increase productivity by 300%"
**Good:** "Drag tasks to 'Done' and feel the satisfaction"
