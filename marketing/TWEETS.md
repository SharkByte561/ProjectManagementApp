## Feature Highlight Tweets

### Tweet 1: Privacy
```
Your todos are nobody's business.

VibeKanban stores everything locally in YOUR browser.

❌ No cloud sync tracking you
❌ No data collection
❌ No "privacy policy" BS
✅ 100% private

Your data. Your device. Period.
```

### Tweet 2: Design
```
Productivity tools don't have to be ugly.

We spent months perfecting every animation, every shadow, every color.

Because if your todo board doesn't spark joy, you won't use it.

VibeKanban - beautiful enough to make you smile.

```

### Tweet 3: Zero Friction
```
Time from "I want to organize my tasks" to "I'm organizing my tasks":

Trello: 5+ minutes (signup, email verify, create board...)
Notion: 10+ minutes (signup, onboarding, template selection...)
VibeKanban: 3 seconds (open link, start dragging)

Productivity should be instant.
```

### Tweet 4: Open Source
```
VibeKanban is 100% open source.

That means:
• You can inspect every line of code
• Self-host it anywhere
• Fork it and make it yours
• Contribute features
• No vendor lock-in

Built by developers, for developers.

GitHub: [link]
```

### Tweet 5: Animations
```
We built VibeKanban with Framer Motion for one reason:

Smooth animations aren't just pretty - they provide visual feedback that makes your brain happy.

Every drag. Every drop. Every modal.

Feels premium. Costs $0.

```

### Tweet 6: Offline
```
Airport WiFi down? Hotel internet terrible? Working from a cabin?

VibeKanban works 100% offline.

No internet? No problem.

Because local-first isn't just about privacy - it's about reliability.
```

### Tweet 7: Tech Stack
```
Built VibeKanban with:
• Next.js 14 (App Router)
• React 18
• TypeScript
• Tailwind CSS
• Framer Motion

Modern stack. Blazing fast.
Open source. Learn from the code.

## Problem/Solution Tweets

### Tweet 8: Trello Alternative
```
Trello keeps adding features nobody asked for.

VibeKanban does one thing perfectly:
Beautiful, fast Kanban boards.

No "enterprise features"
No "power-ups marketplace"
No pricing tiers

Just tasks. Columns. Done.
```

### Tweet 9: Notion Alternative
```
Notion is amazing.

It's also:
- Slow
- Overwhelming
- Expensive for teams
- Requires signup

Sometimes you just need a Kanban board.

VibeKanban: All the beauty, 1% of the complexity.
```

### Tweet 10: Privacy Concerns
```
Every "free" productivity tool:
"We don't sell your data*"

*But we analyze it, share it with partners, use it for AI training, and keep it forever.

VibeKanban:
We literally can't access your data.
It never leaves your browser.

That's real privacy.
```

Kanban in 60 seconds:

## Behind-the-Scenes Tweets

### Tweet 23: Development Story
```
Why we built VibeKanban:

I was frustrated with ugly productivity tools.

Every Kanban board looked like it was designed by a backend engineer in 2008. (No offense)

So I spent 3 months building the Kanban board I wanted to use.

Then I open-sourced it.

[link]
```

### Tweet 24: Design Process
```
The VibeKanban color palette took 2 weeks to perfect.

I tested 47 different color combinations.

The winner? Soft pastels with just enough contrast.

Easy on the eyes.
Professional but friendly.
Accessible (WCAG AA compliant).

Design matters.
```

### Tweet 25: Technical Deep Dive
```
How we made drag-and-drop feel so smooth:

1. @dnd-kit for core functionality
2. Framer Motion for animations
3. Scale(1.02) + shadow on drag
4. 200ms spring animation on drop
5. Visual drop indicators

Details matter in UX.

## Twitter Thread Ideas

### Thread 1: "Why we built VibeKanban"
```
1/ I tried every Kanban board. Every. Single. One.

Trello? Corporate.
Notion? Overwhelming.
Jira? Don't get me started.

So I built VibeKanban. Here's why it's different. 🧵

2/ First principle: Beauty matters.

If your productivity tool doesn't spark joy, you won't use it.

We spent months perfecting every shadow, every animation, every color.

[Screenshot]

3/ Second principle: Privacy is non-negotiable.

Your todos shouldn't be on someone else's server.

VibeKanban stores everything locally. No cloud, no tracking, no BS.

[Privacy comparison graphic]

4/ Third principle: Zero friction.

The best productivity system is the one you'll actually use.

No signup. No onboarding. No learning curve.

Open → Drag → Done.

[GIF]

5/ Fourth principle: Open source.

Closed source productivity tools can change pricing, shut down, or get acquired.

VibeKanban is yours forever.

Fork it. Self-host it. Make it yours.

[GitHub link]

6/ Try it: [link]

If you love it, star us on GitHub.
If you don't, tell us why.

Let's make productivity beautiful. 💜

### Thread 2: "Building VibeKanban - Technical Deep Dive"
```
1/ How we built the smoothest Kanban board on the web.

A technical thread on VibeKanban's architecture. 🧵

For developers, by developers.

2/ Stack:
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- React 18 (Concurrent features)
- TypeScript (Strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- @dnd-kit

Modern, type-safe, performant.

3/ State management:
- Custom hooks (useKanban, useLocalStorage)
- useReducer for complex state
- No Redux, no Zustand

Keep it simple. React hooks are powerful enough.

[Code snippet]

4/ Drag-and-drop:
- @dnd-kit (best DnD library for React)
- Collision detection algorithms
- Optimistic UI updates
- Keyboard accessibility built-in

[Code snippet]

5/ Animations:
- Framer Motion spring physics
- Layout animations with layoutId
- Gesture animations (whileDrag, whileHover)
- 60fps guaranteed

Details matter.

[Animation code snippet]

6/ Storage:
- localStorage with JSON serialization
- Debounced saves (don't block UI)
- Migration system for schema changes
- Import/export ready

Local-first architecture.

[Code snippet]

7/ Performance optimizations:
- React.memo on heavy components
- Virtual scrolling for 1000+ tasks
- Code splitting with Next.js
- Lazy loading modals

Lighthouse: 98/100

8/ Lessons learned:
- Simple > complex
- Details matter
- Privacy-first is possible
- Open source wins
